## Hey there :-)

I'm Simon, a 23 y-o from France. I enjoy poking at malware, writing cool programs and scripts, Oxford commas, and anything related to digital forensics! I'm currently lucky enough to be doing all of that at my job :)

You can chat with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simsor) or check
out some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/simsor). You
can also send me an email (it's on my GitHub profile) but I tend to
forget to reply to e-mails :-/ The best way to get in contact with me
is via my Twitter.
